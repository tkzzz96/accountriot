## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm 9+](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asiifdev/business-leads-ai-automation.git
cd business-leads-ai-automation
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example apps/api/.env
cp .env.example packages/database/.env
```

Edit `apps/api/.env` with your values:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://prospex:yourpassword@localhost:5432/prospex"
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here   # or leave empty for mock AI
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
# Optional: use OpenRouter or Ollama
# OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

### 3. Start infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d         # starts PostgreSQL + Redis
pnpm --filter @prospex/database db:push   # push schema
pnpm --filter @prospex/database exec prisma generate
```

### 4. Run development servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API (port 3001)
pnpm --filter @prospex/api dev

# Terminal 2 — Dashboard (port 3000)
pnpm --filter @prospex/web dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you're in.

## Using OpenRouter / Ollama

Prospex supports any OpenAI-compatible AI provider:

**OpenRouter** (access Claude, Gemini, Llama, etc.):
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-or-your-openrouter-key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
```

**Ollama** (local, fully offline):
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=llama3.2
```

---

## Production Deployment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production values (strong passwords, real API key)

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This starts: PostgreSQL + Redis + NestJS API + Next.js + Nginx.

---

## Development

```bash
pnpm install            # install all dependencies
pnpm dev                # start all apps (requires turbo)
pnpm build              # build all apps
pnpm --filter @prospex/database db:studio   # Prisma Studio (DB browser)
```

## Changelog

### 2026-07-29
- **Fix**: search queries now combine each campaign's search term with every area in its `location` field (split on commas) before scraping — previously `location` was stored but never sent to the scraper, so results could drift to the scraping server's IP-based region instead of the requested cities.
- **Feature**: leads now capture `lat`/`lng` coordinates (parsed from the scraped Google Maps place URL) and store them on the `Lead` model.
- **Feature**: campaign detail page has a new "Map" tab with a Leaflet-based lead map (custom priority-colored markers, auto-fit bounds, popups linking to lead detail) alongside the existing "List" view.
- **Fix**: scraping progress no longer gets stuck at 0% — the scraper now reports incremental progress per search query/area combo while scraping runs (previously progress only updated before scraping started and after it fully finished, so long-running scrapes appeared frozen).
- **Fix**: campaign and lead list polling (every 2s while a campaign is running) no longer flashes the whole page back to a loading skeleton on every refresh — only the initial fetch shows the skeleton, so live progress/lead updates render smoothly.
- **Fix**: lead scoring/ordering no longer ranks by raw star rating alone (a 5.0★ lead with 1 review could previously outrank a 4.5★ lead with thousands of reviews). Review count is now scraped and stored, and rating contribution to the score uses a Bayesian average (weighted toward a neutral 4.0★ prior by review volume) so low-review, high-star leads no longer unfairly beat well-reviewed ones.
